            <p>Hello, my name is Larry Cessna and I'd like to welcome you to my page! A little bit about me:</p>

            <p>
                My professional life has taken me around the world. Literally! I spent 20 years of my life in the US Navy departing in 2015 at the rank of Chief Petty Officer.</p>

            <p>I wanted to change gears and focus on IT. Upon my departure from Active Duty, I worked as an Incident Manager on Microsoft's Escalation Management team. From there I completed my Master of Science in Information/Project Management and began working as a Technical Project Manager for UnitedHealth Group.

</p>

            <p>Now I'm pivoting to Web Development. Becoming a developer has been a dream of mine for a few years. So, I took the leap and applied for University of Washington's Full Stack Javascript bootcamp, which will be completed in November 2020.</p>

            <p>Feel free to look around at some of the projects that I'm proud of on Github. Or even better, reach out and connect with me on LinkedIn!</p>
